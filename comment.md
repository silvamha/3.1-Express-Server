## 01 - GPT Instructions
Let's start by commenting the code blocks to provide a clear understanding of each part. Then, I will create a markdown document explaining the functionality of these code blocks.

### Commented Code Blocks

```javascript
// Import the express module to create a web server
import express from "express";

// Initialize the express application
const app = express();

// Define the port number the server will listen on
const port = 3002;

// Define a route for the GET request to the root URL ("/").
// This function will send "Hello, World!" as a response to any requests to the root URL.
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!")
})

// Start the server and listen on the specified port. 
// Print a message to the console once the server is running and listening for requests.
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}.`);
});
```

# Express Server Explanation

This document explains the functionality of a simple web server created using Express, a popular web framework for Node.js. The server responds with "Hello, World!" to requests to the root URL and listens on port 3002.

## Code Explanation

The code is structured into several parts, each serving a specific purpose in setting up and running the web server:

### Importing Express

```javascript
import express from "express";
```
This line imports the Express framework, making its functionalities available for creating a web server.

### Initializing the Application

```javascript
const app = express();
```
This initializes a new Express application by calling `express()`. The `app` variable represents the application and is used to configure the server and set up routes.

### Defining the Port

```javascript
const port = 3002;
```
The server is set to listen on port 3002. This is a somewhat arbitrary choice; you can use most port numbers, as long as they're not already in use by another process.

### Setting up a Route Handler

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!")
})
```
This sets up a route handler for GET requests to the root URL (`"/"`). When a request is made to the root URL, the server responds with a simple text message, "Hello, World!".

### Starting the Server

```javascript
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}.`);
});
```
This starts the server and makes it listen on the specified port. Once the server is running, a message is logged to the console indicating that the server is successfully running and the port it's listening on.

## Summary

The provided code demonstrates how to set up a basic web server with Express. It covers importing the Express module, initializing the application, defining a port, setting up a route handler to respond to GET requests, and starting the server to listen for requests on a specific port. This server is a foundational example of how web servers are created and run in Node.js using Express.
